        %h2 The combinatorial small-text search engine in Ruby.

        %h2 What it is not
        %p A full-text search engine. If you need that, look at
        %a{ :href => 'http://sphinxsearch.com/' } Sphinx
        or
        %a{ :href => 'http://lucene.apache.org/solr/' } Solr (Lucene)
        \. They will help.
        %h2 What it is
        %p A small-text search engine (web) service.
        %h2 Huh?
        %p A small-text search engine does not operate on huge blobs of text, but instead on smaller, highly categorized text amounts. For example, on varchar database fields.
        %h2 Why?
        %p
          Picky helps your user find data which in a full-text search engine would be buried in a heap of results. Also, it lets him do so with a Google-y single search field.
        %p
          Sure the word "peter" is found most often in document #7, but he actually just wants documents by someone with surname "Peter", and not everything related to peters.
        %p
          Picky helps him refine his search by way of a comfortable interface to get exactly what he wants.
        %h2 How it works
        %p Hoo boy.
        %h2 See me show (it) off
        %p
          Using a real
          %a{ :href => 'http://twixtel.ch' } telephone search
          as an example.

          This was at the fantastic
          %a{ :href => 'http://euruko2010.org/' } EuRuKo 2010
          Conference.
        %h2 How it performs
        %p
          This depends on many factors, but generally we recommend using Picky with a maximum of 120 million data points (we used it there). The area under 20 millions is probably best, indexing-performance wise. Your mileage may vary, of course.
        %h2 Why the octopus?
        %p
          Glad you asked. But first, read this
          %a{ :href => 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus' } Wikipedia entry about octopuses
          \. Finished? Well, I think that sums it up pretty well. And it's cuuuute, don't you think? :)
        %p
          But don't call him that. He likes to be called "Octor the Destroyer".
        %h2 Feedback?
        %p Bring it.
