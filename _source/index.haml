    %p
      Picky is a really
      %strong easy to use
      and
      %strong fast
      Ruby search engine that helps your users
      %strong find what they are looking for.
    %h3 Tryâ€¦
    %p
      A simple
      %a{ :href => 'http://picky-simple-example.heroku.com/' } library example
      (wait 3 seconds for it to boot up).
    %p
      The
      %a{ :href => 'examples.html' } examples section
      offers more.
    %h3 What it is
    %p
      A small-text search engine for categorized data, such as varchar fields from a database (such as most data).
    %p
      It offers a HTTP interface, and a comfortable web front end for your application.

      = succeed('.') do
        %a{ :href => 'details.html' } in Detail section
    %h3 What it is not
    %p
      A full-text search engine for uncategorized data (like text from a book). If you need that, look at
      %a{ :href => 'http://sphinxsearch.com/' } Sphinx
      or
      = succeed('.') do
        %a{ :href => 'http://lucene.apache.org/solr/' } Solr (Lucene)
      They will help.
