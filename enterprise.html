      <h2>Enterprise Ready</h2>
      <div class="grid_1">
        <h2>Surely you're kidding!</h2>
        <p>
          Don't be deceived by the cute appearance! Picky is a tough little bastard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Picky is in use in a telephone search web application, where it handled more than 10 million moderately complex search requests per day.
        </p>
        <h2>Stability</h2>
        <p>
          Codewise, Picky is tested by around 900 unit and integration specs. Code size is extremely small (~4000 loc), making it easy to maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Picky uses Ruby and (currently) Unicorn. We bombarded three servers, running a Unicorn with 8 children each, using ab.
        </p>
        <p>
          After filling the Unicorn request buffers, Picky predictably went down, but recuperating like fresh spring dew after the torrent was over.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the mentioned project, Picky has been running without fail now for more than a year. It has been shown to be totally maintenance free.
        </p>
        <h2>Scalability (requests)</h2>
        <p>
          Picky scales very well with your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend setting up a shared /index directory where one Picky indexes, and the others reload the indexes after restarting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, add the server to your proxy of choice (nginx, varnish etc).
        </p>
        <p>
          We've added two servers to the first one like this, without problems. We just needed to add the new server to the varnish front end round robin list.
        </p>
        <h2>Scalability (data)</h2>
        <p>
          Picky is a combinatorial search engine. Meaning: All the data needs to be available for combining.
        </p>
        <p>
          Admittedly, regarding data,
          <strong>if</strong>
          you have exponential data growth, we do not recommend to use Picky.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your data is slowly growing (linearly), we recommend to use Picky.
        </p>

        <h2>Speed</h2>
        <p>
          Most people think – since it is written in Ruby – it must be slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          That attitude usually stops after seeing it in production or trying the example (in getting started).
        </p>
        <p>
          Lots of consideration went into writing performant Ruby code. For example, each request has a very small memory footprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around 100 specs test for possible performance reductions. Critical parts have been rewritten in C, giving it the edge it needs.
        </p>
        <h2>Modularity</h2>
        <p>
          From the ground up, Picky is designed to be very flexible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Search requests can be routed to any combination of indexes. If you need customized tokenizers etc. you can easily implement them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, it supports quite a few data sources, and new data sources can be easily added.
