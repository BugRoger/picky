h1. Picky Generation

h2. Explanation

Generation uses a prototype project in prototype_project.

This is the project which is used for project generation.

Files are simply copied into the target directory.

No fancy stuff like the generators from Padrino or Rails, but I opted to keep it simple and easily understandable.

h2. Commands

Generates a directory with name @<app_name>@:

  @picky create <app_name>@

Generates a directory with name @<app_name>@, but without any helpful content in @app/application.rb@:

  @picky create <app_name> --no-help@
